### i always thought of having to delete and navigate in command line/terminal. But this sucks. 
Finally i got how to move in the terminal.

- ctrl+A :Naviagate to the begining of line
- ctrl+E :End of the line
- ctrl+K :Delete till the cursor
- ctrl+W :Delete the word
- ctrl+u :Delete the whole line
- pbcopy :get the copy
- pbpaste :Make the paste
